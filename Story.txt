Once upon a time a big city, crossroads of many commercial roads in antic Greece, Athens.

The rise of the city attracted the eye of two mains gods.
In first place Athena goddess of wisdom.
And the second Poseidon master of the Seas.
Each of them exercising its right on it, for Athena the the guardian of this citymust be her because Athens had the most wise.
But Poseidon though that the city returned to him because of the big harbor's presence.
Athena proposed olive trees to the people and Poseidon some horses. All the womens choose the olive trees and the mens the horses
but women were more numerous with one more voice.
It irritates Poseidon who choose to destroy the city of Athens.

YOU ARE POSEIDON AND UNLEASH YOUR WRATH ON THE ATHENIANS !!!!!
